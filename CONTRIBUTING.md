## 📝 Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style (we use Prettier and ESLint)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Handle errors explicitly

### Project Structure

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add notebook execution from CLI
fix: handle connection timeout gracefully

```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run the test suite before submitting PR
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

**Test Structure:**
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('FeatureName', () => {
  it('should handle normal case', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test';
    
    // Act
    const result = await yourFunction(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });

  it('should handle error case', async () => {
    expect(() => yourFunction(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

1. **Check existing issues** - Your bug might already be reported
2. **Update to latest version** - The bug might be fixed
3. **Try to reproduce** - Can you consistently trigger the bug?

### How to Submit a Good Bug Report

Use the bug report template and include:

1. **Clear title** - Summarize the issue in one line
2. **Environment details**:
   - OS and version
   - Node.js version (`node --version`)
   - Package version (`lecoder-cgpu --version`)
3. **Steps to reproduce** - Exact commands that trigger the bug
4. **Expected behavior** - What should happen
5. **Actual behavior** - What actually happens
6. **Error messages** - Full error output with `--verbose`
7. **Screenshots/logs** - If applicable

**Example:**
```markdown
## Bug: Connection hangs on macOS 14.1

**Environment:**
- OS: macOS 14.1 Sonoma
- Node.js: v20.10.0
- lecoder-cgpu: v0.5.0

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run `lecoder-cgpu connect`
2. Complete OAuth flow
3. Runtime creation succeeds but connection hangs

**Expected:** Should open interactive shell
**Actual:** Hangs indefinitely with spinner

**Error output:**
```
[verbose logs here]
```
```

## 📦 Release Process (Maintainers)

Releases involve both npm package publication and binary distribution. See [INSTALLATION.md - Publishing to NPM](./INSTALLATION.md#publishing-to-npm-maintainers-only) for complete instructions.

### Quick Release Checklist

- [ ] Version bumped in `package.json`

### Automated Preparation

Use the `prepare-release.sh` script to automate most steps:

```bash
./scripts/prepare-release.sh 0.5.2
```

This will:

- Run tests and build
- Build and test all platform binaries
- Verify npm package contents
- Generate checksums

After running the script:
1. Review and update `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Commit changes
3. Follow npm publishing workflow (see INSTALLATION.md)
4. Create Git tag and GitHub release

### Distribution Channels

- **npm Registry**: For users installing via `npm install -g lecoder-cgpu`
